run **NPM START** to start *localhost*



-----------------------------
***ADDITIONAL INFO:***

I have tried to keep the functionality of the app to a minimum, fulfilling all requirements.

The progress is initiated not at 0 but at the percentage provided by the API(36%).

**ONLY** once all tasks have been completed and 100% has been reached a link appears at the bottom which (not functional at the moment) takes the user to the next step.
